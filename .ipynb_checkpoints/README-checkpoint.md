Group: Alivia Missimer and Jessica Baek 

## What does the software do
The software asks for a userinput for their name and then a yes or no answer using a 0/1 response system. 0 indicating that they are cold and 1 indicating that they are hot. 


## How to use the software
It has a variable called name which asks for your name as an input. Then, it has another variable called temp which asks
if if you are cold type 0 and if you are hot type 1 as an input. If you type 0, then it prints out "It is winter" and 
if you type 1, then it prints out "It is summer".


## How to install: 

Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
Type in "git clone https://github.com/jhb59/Version-Control-Group-39.git" and hit the enter key
This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called Version-Control-Group-39)

## Why we chose our license and code of conduct
We chose this particular license becuase it aligned with what our project had been doing. It also explained the different parts of a license and was through and detailed. 

The code of conduct we chose explicitly states the different parts of the code and were in phrases that non-coders could understand
